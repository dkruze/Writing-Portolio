# Daniel Kruze Writing Portolio 2025
This repository contains .txt and .pdf versions of my selected writings. Technical documents, critiques, and essays from various points in the last 5 years. Some of these may already be included in different repositories on this github. The given writings vary in subject, size, and even form, but not in style. They represent the development of my writing style over a long period, comprising works from my time as a student, my time as a worker, and my own, personal writings regarding arts and culture. Due to the confidential nature of my position at Eurofins, technical writings regarding my lab work may not be legally posted due to their specific natures. I no longer have access to them, as they are located on secure, client servers.

These writings are organized into two subdirectories, one for PDF writings and one for TXT writings. Among the PDF writings are essays, reports, mathematical proofs, and tutorials from my time as a student. These comprise my most "academic" work, and represent my ability to write formally and technically. Among the TXT writings are a series of critiques, some longer than others, of films both historical and modern, which represents the bulk of my hobby writing. I like to have thoughts written and organized for the art I study, which includes films, paintings, music, and even video games. This folder also includes one writing that summarizes my thoughts on my own approach to developing style in music, titled "Old Wave."

Below is a comprehensive list of the included writings, that may be appended or revised as things are added or removed from this repository in the future. In this list, a brief description of each file will be included.

<ul>
<li> PDFs
 <ul>
 <li> "CloudComputingThesis_2023"
  
 *The written summary of my student thesis, which analyzed the feasability of investing in new cloud computing technologies for universities. The codebase/data being referenced in the document is included in my thesis repository on          this github page.*
 </li>
 <li> "CSharp-Summary"
  
 *An introductory analysis of how a new C# and .NET environment functions on a local machine. This is not a comprehensive tutorial, but it serves as a technical introduction to its basic functions and provides a critique of its central design. This is intended as a research document.*
 </li>
 <li> "FrancisBaconAndDavidLynch"
  
 *This was one of the first formal art critiques I ever wrote, and it concerns the entire body of David Lynch's work as a painter and filmmaker. I hypothesize that Francis Bacon's painting "Sphinx" was a significant influence on Lynch's preferred imagery, on the basis that Lynch was a self-professed lover of Bacon's work. At the least, the painting provides a microcosm of Lynch's obsession with Bacon.*
 </li>
 <li> "FSharp-Tutorial"
  
 *A more comprehensive, technical tutorial , including a background explanation, on the applications of basic, object-oriented programming principles to F#, a functional language in the .NET environment. This tutorial includes activities designed to reinforce understanding of F# and its design principles, almost as "homework" in a sense. It is intended both as a research document and as a textbook to learn alongside for beginners to functional languages.*
 </li>
 <li> "ModalLogic-Portfolio"
  
 *A portfolio of some mathematical, aristotelian logic proofs written during my undergrad, which I siphoned from work I had done in previous classes. The content of these proofs is sort of esoteric, but it is included in this github as a formal exercise. This document was created entirely in Microsoft Word, and represents my organizational skills within technical documents.*
 </li>
 <li> "NessoEcologicalReport_2021"
  
 *This paper concerns a project undertaken by myself and the management of Nesso Italian Kitchen, a former employer of mine, to track the ecological impact of some of the restaurant's operations. This was compiled at the suggestion of an ecology professor of mine at the time, and is written in a typical "academic paper" style with pictures and diagrams. Note the lengthy, annotated bibliography, which is a less common fixture which I personally find both charming and trustworthy in a scientific document.*

<li> TXTs

 <li> "GlenorGlenda_1953"
  
 *My longest written work concerning a single film, this document consists of my initial thoughts regarding Ed Wood's first film appended to the bottom of a larger essay on its implications. The essay argues for a certain perspective on Wood's own repressed gender identity, and how his perceived struggle for acceptance can instruct us on current attitudes among marginalized, queer communities.*
 </li>
 <li> "Greed_1924"
  
 *A critique of Erich von Stroheim's silent film "Greed." The film is famous for being mostly lost, and for its early adoption of many naturalistic cinema techniques, among other things.*
 </li>
 <li> "KillersoftheFlowerMoon_2023"
  
 *Another of my longest writings on film, this is a summary and analysis of the themes in Martin Scorsese's "Killers of the Flower Moon." Most of the analysis centers on how the film eschews formal concerns in favor of explicit, political messaging.*
 </li>
 <li> "Metropolis_1927"
  
 *A critique of Fritz Lang's silent epic "Metropolis," one of the most famous films of all time. Also partially missing, this film is deeply important not only for the many concepts it invented, but also for its unbelievable scale.*
 </li>
 <li> "OldWave_2025"
  
 *This is a writing describing my own conception of style in electronic (and analog, to an extent,) music, both in how I personally have developed it as a musician/producer, and also how I think it should be studied and perceived academically. This writing covers some of my personal influences and their methods, attempting to describe what we can learn from their experimental methods. I also discuss how the idea of genre can be limiting to our ability to interpret art as abstract or emotive.*
 </li>
 <li> "Onibaba_1960"
  
 *An analysis of the political themes and imagery in Kaneto Shindo's "Onibaba." Shindo, as a student of Kenji Mizoguchi, is considered an important figure in film for his unorthodox approach to dialogue and inclusion of leftist themes at a pivotal time in the development of a Japanese new wave movement in film.*
 </li>
 <li> "ThroneofBlood_1957"
  
 *A critique of Akira Kurosawa's "Throne of Blood," his loose adaptation of Macbeth into a Jidaigeki film. The film endures because of its unsimulated archery stunts toward the end, but it is also notable for its radical approach to adapted material.*
 </li>
 <li> "Vampyr_1932"
  
 *An analysis of Carl Theodor Dreyer's "Vampyr," and a breakdown of his methods by assessing his own writings and speeches. This is his most enduring film, and may be his most experimental in its approach to horrific imagery.*
