# Daniel Kruze Writing Portfolio 2025
This repository contains .txt and .pdf versions of my selected writings. Technical documents, critiques, and essays from various points in the last 5 years. Some of these may already be included in different repositories on this github. The given writings vary in subject, size, and even form, but not in style. They represent the development of my writing style over a long period, comprising works from my time as a student, my time as a worker, and my own, personal writings regarding arts and culture. Due to the confidential nature of my position at Eurofins, technical writings regarding my lab work may not be legally posted due to their specific natures. I no longer have access to them, as they are located on secure, client servers.

These writings are organized into two subdirectories, one for PDF writings and one for TXT writings. Among the PDF writings are essays, reports, mathematical proofs, and tutorials from my time as a student. These comprise my most "academic" work, and represent my ability to write formally and technically. Among the TXT writings are a series of critiques, some longer than others, of films both historical and modern, which represents the bulk of my hobby writing. I like to have thoughts written and organized for the art I study, which includes films, paintings, music, and even video games. This folder also includes one writing that summarizes my thoughts on my own approach to developing style in music, titled "Old Wave."

The style of my academic writing has developed over the years from the influences of Ludwig Wittgenstein, Bertrand Russell, and David Hume. Studying an eclectic variety of philosophical and political writings early in my life gave me a taste for verbose and descriptive writing, which is why I have also come to take inspiration from many Marxist thinkers and their vivid, mathematical depictions of political theory. Marx himself, as well as Theodor Adorno and Amadeo Bordiga have been revelations to me, as well as other political thinkers such as Michel Foucault. I also admire some novelist philosophers, like Aldous Huxley, Daniel Quinn, and HG Wells, though their writing styles are sort of beyond my reckoning. In terms of critique, I learned much of my affinity for capsule-style writing from novelist and video game critic Ben "Yahtzee" Croshaw, an unlikely hero of narrative critique on the popular internet in the 2000s. As I've gotten older, studying Adorno has informed a lot of my approach to artwork, but I have also taken significant inspiration from the writings of Jonathan Rosenbaum and David J Skal, as well as the thoughts of Andre Bazin and the team of Straub-Huillet. My reckoning of film has recently been inspired heavily by directors Carl Theodor Dreyer, Jean-Luc Godard, and Jacques Rivette, as well as Brazilian critic Filipe Furtado.

Below is a comprehensive list of the included writings, that may be appended or revised as things are added or removed from this repository in the future. In this list, a brief description of each file will be included.

<ul>
<li> PDFs
 <ul>
 <li> "CloudComputingThesis_2023"
  
 *The written summary of my student thesis, which analyzed the feasability of investing in new cloud computing technologies for universities. The codebase/data being referenced in the document is included in my thesis repository on          this github page.*
 </li>
 <li> "CSharp-Summary"
  
 *An introductory analysis of how a new C# and .NET environment functions on a local machine. This is not a comprehensive tutorial, but it serves as a technical introduction to its basic functions and provides a critique of its central design. This is intended as a research document.*
 </li>
 <li> "FrancisBaconAndDavidLynch"
  
 *This was one of the first formal art critiques I ever wrote, and it concerns the entire body of David Lynch's work as a painter and filmmaker. I hypothesize that Francis Bacon's painting "Sphinx" was a significant influence on Lynch's preferred imagery, on the basis that Lynch was a self-professed lover of Bacon's work. At the least, the painting provides a microcosm of Lynch's obsession with Bacon.*
 </li>
 <li> "FSharp-Tutorial"
  
 *A more comprehensive, technical tutorial , including a background explanation, on the applications of basic, object-oriented programming principles to F#, a functional language in the .NET environment. This tutorial includes activities designed to reinforce understanding of F# and its design principles, almost as "homework" in a sense. It is intended both as a research document and as a textbook to learn alongside for beginners to functional languages.*
 </li>
 <li> "ModalLogic-Portfolio"
  
 *A portfolio of some mathematical, aristotelian logic proofs written during my undergrad, which I siphoned from work I had done in previous classes. The content of these proofs is sort of esoteric, but it is included in this github as a formal exercise. This document was created entirely in Microsoft Word, and represents my organizational skills within technical documents.*
 </li>
 <li> "NessoEcologicalReport_2021"
  
 *This paper concerns a project undertaken by myself and the management of Nesso Italian Kitchen, a former employer of mine, to track the ecological impact of some of the restaurant's operations. This was compiled at the suggestion of an ecology professor of mine at the time, and is written in a typical "academic paper" style with pictures and diagrams. Note the lengthy, annotated bibliography, which is a less common fixture which I personally find both charming and trustworthy in a scientific document.*
 </li>
  <li> "TekkenTextbook"
  
 *This longform tutorial was written off the cuff before and during the first year of the video game Tekken 8. It is intended as a textbook for beginners, comprising all the knowledge I had accumulated as a veteran of the game's previous installments. The subject matter may seem niche or simply silly, but the game's complexity demanded a significant investment with annotated references. I have touched this up since its initial release to be more exact, accurate, and slightly less slanderous toward my own in-game opponents. It serves now as one of my biggest "hobby" projects at around 50 pages, and the information is still largely valuable for current players of Tekken 8. It presumes a level of familiarity with similar video games, but provides a ground-up analysis of Tekken's specific systems, from the most basic to the most niche.*

<li> TXTs

 <li> "GlenorGlenda_1953"
  
 *My longest written work concerning a single film, this document consists of my initial thoughts regarding Ed Wood's first film appended to the bottom of a larger essay on its implications. The essay argues for a certain perspective on Wood's own repressed gender identity, and how his perceived struggle for acceptance can instruct us on current attitudes among marginalized, queer communities.*
 </li>
 <li> "Greed_1924"
  
 *A critique of Erich von Stroheim's silent film "Greed." The film is famous for being mostly lost, and for its early adoption of many naturalistic cinema techniques, among other things.*
 </li>
 <li> "KillersoftheFlowerMoon_2023"
  
 *Another of my longest writings on film, this is a summary and analysis of the themes in Martin Scorsese's "Killers of the Flower Moon." Most of the analysis centers on how the film eschews formal concerns in favor of explicit, political messaging.*
 </li>
 <li> "Metropolis_1927"
  
 *A critique of Fritz Lang's silent epic "Metropolis," one of the most famous films of all time. Also partially missing, this film is deeply important not only for the many concepts it invented, but also for its unbelievable scale.*
 </li>
 <li> "OldWave_2025"
  
 *This is a writing describing my own conception of style in electronic (and analog, to an extent,) music, both in how I personally have developed it as a musician/producer, and also how I think it should be studied and perceived academically. This writing covers some of my personal influences and their methods, attempting to describe what we can learn from their experimental methods. I also discuss how the idea of genre can be limiting to our ability to interpret art as abstract or emotive.*
 </li>
 <li> "Onibaba_1960"
  
 *An analysis of the political themes and imagery in Kaneto Shindo's "Onibaba." Shindo, as a student of Kenji Mizoguchi, is considered an important figure in film for his unorthodox approach to dialogue and inclusion of leftist themes at a pivotal time in the development of a Japanese new wave movement in film.*
 </li>
 <li> "ThroneofBlood_1957"
  
 *A critique of Akira Kurosawa's "Throne of Blood," his loose adaptation of Macbeth into a Jidaigeki film. The film endures because of its unsimulated archery stunts toward the end, but it is also notable for its radical approach to adapted material.*
 </li>
 <li> "Vampyr_1932"
  
 *An analysis of Carl Theodor Dreyer's "Vampyr," and a breakdown of his methods by assessing his own writings and speeches. This is his most enduring film, and may be his most experimental in its approach to horrific imagery.*
